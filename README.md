## Model

The GNN model is trained to classify articles as real or fake based on their graph representation.

- Uses a heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GNN)
- Trained on synthetic graphs generated from input text
- Classification done on the article node type
- Includes confidence score outputs and evaluation metrics

---

##  Sample Metrics

- Accuracy: 96.01%
- F1-Score (weighted): 0.9601
- Precision/Recall balanced for real and fake labels
- Confusion Matrix included in evaluation logs
